<h2>Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22892838">Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel</a> is an ongoing study on 100 strains of inbred mice.  Clinical phenotypes, metabolites, proteins, expression, SNPs and CG methylation were measured in the mice.  Associations were tested for using the <a href="http://mouse.cs.ucla.edu/emma/">Efficient Mixed-Model Associations (EMMA)</a> test.
</p>
<p>
Associations are shown as edges in the network tool.  The weakest viewable is 1e-6.  The graphical network tool was implemented using the <a href="http://philogb.github.io/jit/">Javascript Infovis Toolkit</a>.
